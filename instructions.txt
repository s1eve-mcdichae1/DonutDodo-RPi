Donut Dodo - RetroPie Edition

The game is a native RetroPie Port and should be compatible with Raspberry Pi models 3B, 4A, 4B and 400.
It might work on other models, but that is still TBC.

Game instructions:
This is a lightweight and highly optimized native port of the game in its purest form, made for arcade enthusiasts.
As such, in order to create an authentic arcade experience, the main menu has been removed.

Access the Options Menu (from the Start Screen):
- press "O" for Options on the keyboard
- press "Home" or "L2" on a controller

Exit the game (from the Start Screen):
- press "Escape" on the keyboard for 1 second
- press "Cancel" on the controller for 1 second (the B button on an Xbox controller)

Add a credit (from the Start Screen):
- "5" on the keyboard
- "Select" on the controller

Start game (from the mode selection screen):
- "1" on the keyboard
- "Start" on the controller

Player movement:
- Arrow keys on the keyboard for movement, and "Space" to jump
- Dpad on the controller for movement, and "A" (on an Xbox controller) to jump


Known issues:
- Audio can sometimes crack or pop in bluetooth mode

Further notes:
- I will be adding visual assets in the future so that players can create their own bezels and/or marquees
